#### Introduction:
Welcome to the OOP Lab Tasks repository! This project demonstrates various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. The repository includes implementations of common OOP principles through practical tasks designed to enhance understanding and proficiency in Java.
#### Description:
The OOP Lab Tasks project covers fundamental and advanced concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Each task is implemented as a standalone Java application, showcasing different aspects of OOP principles.

#### Features:
1. **Class and Object Management**: Explore how to create and manipulate classes and objects.
2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Understand and implement class hierarchies and method overriding.
3. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: Learn about data hiding and abstract classes.
4. **File Handling and Data Persistence**: Implement file operations to save and retrieve data.

#### Tasks Overview:
1. **Task 1 - Basic Class Implementation**:
   - Define and instantiate classes.
   - Implement basic methods and constructors

2. **Task 2 - Inheritance and Method Overriding**:
   - Create a base class and derived classes.
   - Override methods and explore method polymorphism.

3. **Task 3 - Encapsulation and Data Hiding**:
   - Use access modifiers to encapsulate data.
   - Implement getter and setter methods.
  
4. **Task 4 - Abstraction and Interfaces**:
   - Define abstract classes and interfaces.
   - Implement abstract methods and interface methods.

5. **Task 5 - File Handling**:
   - Read and write data to files.
   - Manage data persistence with file operations.

#### Benefits:
1. **Enhanced Understanding**: Gain hands-on experience with core OOP concepts through practical examples.
2. **Code Organization**: Apply OOP principles to solve real-world problems in Java.
3. **Improved Skills**: Develop a solid foundation in Java programming and OOP.

#### Development:
The project is developed in Java and leverages Java's object-oriented features. Each task includes detailed comments and explanations to aid learning and understanding.

#### Conclusion:
The OOP Lab Tasks repository serves as a valuable resource for students and programmers looking to strengthen their understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in Java. Each task is designed to be a practical example, making it easier to grasp and apply OOP principles.

Feel free to explore the tasks, modify the code, and contribute improvements to enhance the project further!
